# JavaScriptTetris
In Tetris, players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. 
The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. 
The game ends when the uncleared lines reach the top of the playing field. The longer the player can delay this outcome, the higher their score will be.
This small project is a variation of Tetris created using simple Javascript and HTML
